# CPP_Online_Refresher

I took a course on coursera to shake off my rust when it comes to c coding. I decided to document my journey over the course of about 2 days through this free class that can be located here: [link](https://www.coursera.org/learn/cs-fundamentals-1) 

This repository is NOT a full representation of my C++ knowledge. The course was easier than I thought it was going to be, but you live and you learn, I guess. I do think the course helped me shake the rust off though! I plan on doing my own c++ project now that I have gotten back in the groove, so hopefully that will be on my github by the time you read this!

Have a great day, and thanks for stopping by!
